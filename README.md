- 👋 Hey there, I’m Marcio Barbosa. 
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, technology and, wait for it... TECHNOLOGY
- 🌱 I’m currently fullstack delphi developer; learning React and NodeJS
- 💞️ Passionate about as you know, TECHNOLOGY, but even more about growing and bringing others with me
- 📫 Why don't you talk to me through linked.in? :D ▶️ www.linkedin.com/in/barbosamarcio-

Now take some craic:
- ✨ My truly passion for technology and development burned when I was 9yo with a game called TIBIA. 
- ✨ My friend and I decided to create our own Tibia Server and WE MADE IT
- ✨ I started to learn about lua scripts and my very first script was a right click button function that
when we right clicked on a mirror, the outfit screen appeared 😍😍
- ✨ So we migrated to GTA where again we decided to have our own online server and I learned a little bit of PAWN (C-like syntax)
- ✨ When 12yo my mom decided to put me in a Game Development course where I have learned C# and started SQL and a bit of Unity 3D
- ✨ And a little time jump, in the college (18yo) I have learned web development (html, css, js) but I started the big boys job and
have never focused on these web tools **'TIL NOW**
- ✨ I'm programming in Delphi since then
