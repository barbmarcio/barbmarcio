**_Now take some craic:_**
- ✨ My truly passion for technology and development burned when I was 9yo with a game called TIBIA. 
- ✨ My friend and I decided to create our own Tibia Server and WE MADE IT
- ✨ I started to learn about lua scripts and my very first script was a right click button function that
when we right clicked on a mirror, the outfit screen appeared 😍😍
- ✨ So we migrated to GTA where again we decided to have our own online server and I learned a little bit of PAWN (C-like syntax)
- ✨ When 12yo my mom decided to put me in a Game Development course where I have learned C# and started SQL and a bit of Unity 3D
- ✨ And a little time jump, in the college (18yo) I have learned web development (html, css, js), but I started the big boy job life and
have never focused on these web tools **'TIL NOW**, because we only developed Delphi apps at work
- ✨ I've been programming in Delphi since then (2015) and decided to make 2021 my revolutionary year, putting all my acquired programming logics
through all these years in web dev tools 😁😁
