👋 Olá! I’m **Marcio Barbosa** – and I have a question for you:

How big of a human problem are you trying to solve?

From **Brazil** (🇧🇷) to the **world** (🌍), I’m a seasoned **Tech Lead**, **Software Engineer**, **Musician**, and a proud follower of **Jesus**. My life flows between lines of code and melodies of worship.

💡 **Fun Facts:**

	•	💻 **Managed a team of 36 developers** (yes, 36!) and lived to tell the tale.
	•	✈️ **Almost a pilot** – but decided I preferred “flying” through code instead.
	•	✝️ **Faith-driven** – My greatest inspiration comes from my faith in Jesus; everything I do, I do to bring glory to Him.

🌟 **Career Highlights:**

	•	💡 **Led teams and contributed to projects** for **eBay**, **Florida Power & Light**, and **Sword Health** – ensuring code quality, mitigating risks, and keeping the bugs at bay.

	•	🏆 Achieved a **100% client satisfaction** rating and received a **recognition certificate** – no, I’m not kidding!

🌎 **Language Skills:**

	•	💬 Fluent in **Portuguese** (native) and **English** (C2 level), with some basic **French** for when I want to sound a bit more sophisticated (A2 level).
